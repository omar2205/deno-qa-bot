# Deno QA bot

Helps you bootstrap a bot to answer questions using Deno and [transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js).

By default, it uses a simple model, follow transformers.js guide to use more powerful models.

You can use `omar2205/roberta-base-squad2-onnx`. It's a bit more powerful, and uses more RAM, sometimes you will hit the memory limit in Deno Deploy.
